The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of binary addition and its theoretical and practical applications. To achieve this, I will explain one of the simplest methods for adding two binary numbers: the half adder. A half adder is a circuit designed to compute the first digit of binary addition. This circuit serves as the foundation for more complex circuits, such as the full adder and the 4-bit adder.

As a brief recap, binary numbers consist only of 0s and 1s, unlike decimal numbers, which use digits from 0 to 9. Because binary has fewer digits, numbers grow in size more quickly compared to decimal. For example, the decimal sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 corresponds to 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101 in binary.
