The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of binary addition and its theoretical and practical applications. To achieve this, I will explain one of the simplest methods for adding two binary numbers: the half adder. A half adder is a circuit designed to compute the first digit of binary addition. This circuit serves as the foundation for more complex circuits, such as the full adder and the 4-bit adder.

As a brief recap, binary numbers consist only of 0s and 1s, unlike decimal numbers, which use digits from 0 to 9. Because binary has fewer digits, numbers grow in size more quickly compared to decimal. For example, the decimal sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 corresponds to 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101 in binary.

In the diagram, the half adder (HA) takes two inputs, A and B, representing the two binary digits to be added. The sum is output through S, while Cout represents the carry digit, which is passed to the next place value. The half adder consists of two logic gates: an XOR gate and an AND gate. The XOR gate computes the sum, while the AND gate determines the carry value.
